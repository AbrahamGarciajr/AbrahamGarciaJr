### A Little More Info
<div>
I am originally from Oakland, CA. I wanted to be a teacher at first but did a good old flip switch after I received my degree and credentials. Now I am an up-and-coming Software Engineer looking forward to what the future has in store! I am a huge fan of the Lakers, but you wouldn't guess that from the way I talk about them. I am also a fan of the Raiders and A's, but I can only go to a baseball game to watch itâ€”I just can't sit down in front of a TV and watch baseball. I'll watch any sport, honestly. I also enjoy playing video games in my free time with my cousins. Send me your Fortnite or Rocket League handles, and we can play!

<div>
I have amazing parents and a sister, along with a 16-year-old white, crusty white dog and three very hefty cats. I love spending time with my extended familyâ€”you just have to know when is the right time to leave the function (hint: when anything political is brought up). If you are coming from my LinkedIn, I have done volunteer work, but I'm just too lazy to put it in there. It was all done in high school as a teacher's aide for my teachers and by helping/reading to younger students in elementary schools.
